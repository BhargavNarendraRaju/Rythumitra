Rythumitra addresses the critical information gap for Telugu-speaking farmers through an AI- powered vernacular assistant. The solution integrates three specialized agriculture LLMs with real-time satellite data and localized knowledge bases to deliver context-aware farming advice. Key innovations include a multi-LLM routing architecture with Telugu-optimized embeddings, hybrid retrieval systems for vernacular queries, and agricultural safety guardrails. The mobile- first web interface supports 100+ million Telugu speakers with zero-install access. Current implementation achieves 83% accuracy on crop advisory tasks while reducing hallucination rates by 62% compared to general-purpose models.
